TRYING TO CONVINCE FROSH TO COME TO SJSU and JOIN MESA:
WHY?
	E.g. Make the audience care about your topic.
	E.g. Give reasons why this topic is important now – the rationale or business case.
	E.g. Say why you have chosen this aspect to talk about.
WHAT?
	E.g. Explain your idea.
	E.g. Outline the key message or concept.
	E.g. Present the theory.
HOW?
	E.g. Give the evidence that supports your idea.
	E.g. Explain how it works.
	E.g. Give compelling examples.
WHAT IF? – RISKS
	It is best if you can put yourself into the minds of the audience and think in advance what they might ask. This will show that you have thought through potential problems.

	E.g. Anticipate the audience’s objections or awkward questions – and answer them.
	E.g. Talk about what could go wrong – and how you plan to deal with that or avoid it.
	E.g. Highlight any potential counter-example to your idea – and deal with it positively.
WHAT IF? – CALL TO ACTION & BENEFITS
	E.g. What do you want the audience to do?
	E.g. Who will benefit?
	E.g. How will they benefit?
	E.g. Describe the new reality.

story boarding:
why sjsu and why mesa
mesa supports students from the college of engineering AND the college of Science

confused about how to tie in how MESA supports more than just the college of engineering, but the slides are mainly for the college of engineering

clarification about how to differentiate between MESA Engineering Program and college prep MESA
	- maybe make a slide to differentiate 
	- branding

Meeting with Matt
MAKE THIS YOUR VIRTUAL PROJECT
	- need done in 2 weeks / end of the month

get input from Janeth and Stacy
	- MAINLY JANETH cause she is outreach

wants a presentation that can do it all, and can skip slides when needed
- maybe differentiate resourse for prospective senior vs incoming frosh
- TAYLOR THIS TOO: highschool senior, prospective community college students
	- main goal: say that if you dont come here, you SHOULD pursue STEM and join a MESA program
		- what is MESA
		- what is OUR MESA
		- what is college like (what to worry about)
			- we are from the college of engineering, but we are college students in STEM 
				- pursue college, mesa, PLEASE
